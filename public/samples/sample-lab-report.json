Total Cholesterol is slightly elevated at 210 mg/dL. LDL Cholesterol is at the upper end of near-optimal range. Recommend dietary modifications and follow-up lipid panel in 3-6 months.\n\n=== NOTE ===\n\nResults should be interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider in the context of the patient's overall health status and medical history.",
